In the year 2030 [[Notes/Templum Norma (Naós Nórma) - Loyals of The Eye🖤\|Templum Norma (Naós Nórma) - Loyals of The Eye🖤]] were established.

These nations united, as oppressors of the world became the equalizers of mankind.
At that time the sun started becoming weaker and the world became a cold, inhospitable place.
By 2043 the entire world is frozen over, except for the equator.
Their systems of total control began to collapse in on themselves in 2033.

Finally the world split into two new factions in 2042.
On the one side [[Notes/Legions of Tesem - Heralds of the North🧬\|Legions of Tesem - Heralds of the North🧬]] and on the other side the [[Notes/Order of Pisces 💪\|Order of Pisces 💪]].
Spread throughout the world both factions are fighting for global control.
The Order of Pisces now controls roughly half of the Earth although its population is a lot smaller.
[[Notes/Legions of Tesem - Heralds of the North🧬\|Legions of Tesem - Heralds of the North🧬]] want to re-establish the abyss of [[Notes/Templum Norma (Naós Nórma) - Loyals of The Eye🖤\|Templum Norma (Naós Nórma) - Loyals of The Eye🖤]].

Despising everything holy to man, they seek to replace things with concoctions of their twisted philosophy.

The [[Notes/Order of Pisces 💪\|Order of Pisces 💪]] is building the old world,
where freedom, aspiration, discernment, and human dignity are cherished.

The current year is 2049. Recent movement of tectonic plates allowed an energy-rich substance to emerge to the surface. It has the appearance of black tar and is commonly known as 'the [[Sludge\|Sludge]]'.

[[Sludge\|Sludge]] is now the most sought-after and most fought-over resource in the world.
